# Operator Counting Program: #
This project is a console application that reads a *.cpp file from a user-specified full path and calculates the total number of unary, binary, and ternary operators within the file's content.

## Features :
Operator Counting:
Counts unary (+, -, etc.), binary (+=, ==, etc.), and ternary (?:) operators.
Operators within comment lines (//, /* */) and string literals ("...") are excluded.
Java Programming Language: Developed using Java in the Eclipse IDE.
Regex Utilization: Regular expressions (regex) are used for code parsing.

## Usage :
Run the program and enter the full path to the file via the console
The program will read the specified file, count the operators, and print the result on the console
